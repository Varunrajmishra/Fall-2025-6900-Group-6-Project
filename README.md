# 🌉 Capstone Project 6900_01_Group 6 Fall 2025: PANYNJ Tunnels and Bridges Traffic Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is the final Data Analytics Capstone for Group 6 at the University of New Haven, developed in partnership with The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). The goal is to perform a robust analysis of traffic and speed data across PANYNJ's key facilities, including the Holland Tunnel, George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and other outer bridges. The analysis aims to provide insights to help mitigate negative effects on facility operations and overall regional mobility.

* **Semester:** Fall 2025 

## 🎯 Project Goals and Analysis

The project was designed to address several critical business questions for The Port Authority :

* **Usage Factors:** Identify the top five factors that affect the usage of bridges and terminals by drivers.
* **Toll Violations:** Quantify the number of toll violators by year, month, week, and facility (tunnel, bridge, etc.).
* **Busiest Times:** Determine the busiest times throughout the year and analyze how traffic is affected by factors like seasonality, toll violators, car type, holidays, and NYC-related events.
* **Congestion & Pricing:** Report on congestion due to pricing in 2025 and identify shifts in traffic patterns as drivers attempt to avoid tolls.
* **Forecasting:** Forecast facility usage by year beyond 2025 to the maximum possible year.

## 🧠 Modeling and Technology

Two primary prediction models were developed for the forecasting goal:

1.  **AutoML Model:** A prediction model was developed using the AutoML feature on the Azure platform, and the best-suggested model was utilized.
2.  **Python Implementation:** The model chosen by AutoML was then developed and implemented using **Python code** within Jupyter Notebooks on the Anaconda platform.
